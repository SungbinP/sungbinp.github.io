There are long-standing worker shortages in the US healthcare industry, pre-dating the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of COVID-19 vaccine mandates on shortages is ex ante ambiguous. If mandates increase perceived safety of the healthcare industry, marginal workers may be drawn to healthcare, relaxing shortages. On the other hand, if marginal workers are vaccine hesitant or averse, then mandates may push workers away from the industry and exacerbate shortages. We combine monthly data from the Current Population Survey 2021 to 2022 with difference-in-differences methods to study the effects of state vaccine mandates on the probability of working in healthcare, and of employment transitions into and out of the industry. Our findings suggest that vaccine mandates may have worsened healthcare workforce shortages: following adoption of a state-level mandate, the probability of working in the healthcare industry declines by 6%. Effects are larger among workers in healthcare-specific occupations, who leave the industry at higher rates in response to mandates and are slower to be replaced than workers in non-healthcare occupations. Findings suggest trade-offs faced by health policymakers seeking to achieve multiple health objectives.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="DWB2024" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Death Without Benefits: Unemployment Insurance, Re-Employment, and the Spread of Covid</div> <div class="author"> Sungbin Park, Kyung Min Lee, and John S Earle </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>The University of Chicago Stone Center Working Paper Series</em>, 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="award btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">IPUMS 2023 CPS Research Award</a> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4855532" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="award hidden d-print-inline"> <p></p> <p>link: https://www.ipums.org/impact/ipums-research-award#cps “Park and colleagues exploit state-level variation in the reduction of unemployment benefits during the summer of 2021 to examine the impacts on re-employment behavior across adjacent months of the Current Population Survey (CPS) between February and August of 2021 and on COVID outcomes. They find that state-level reductions in unemployment benefits both increased the likelihood of re-employment and reduced the time to re-employment, but also resulted in increased COVID cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.”</p> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>During a pandemic, unemployment insurance (UI) may have externalities for health. Studying variation across states in UI benefit cuts during summer 2021, using longitudinally linked Current Population Survey data, and controlling for individual and state characteristics, we find that unemployment-employment transitions rise 10 percentage points (42 percent of the untreated mean) in treated states that cut UI early, relative to states maintaining higher benefits. Estimates of hazards and censored regressions imply a benefit elasticity of unemployment duration of 0.5-0.7. Using an instrumental variables strategy, we find sharp covid rises in states with higher re-employment rates because of the UI cuts: case, hospitalization, and death rates are all estimated to more than double. Consistent with a causal interpretation, the differences between treated and other states in re-employment and covid outcomes are negligible prior to treatment, diverge simultaneously with the policy change, and reconverge quickly after the end of the policy difference. Results are robust to controlling for other relevant factors and policies. We estimate that additional wages of \1.1bln received by re-employed workers offset only one-eighth of the UI losses, and, even from a government budget perspective, UI savings are more than offset by increased hospitalization costs of \14.8bln. Increases in illness-related losses in work time can be valued at $1.5bln. Beyond the monetary and morbidity costs of the UI cuts, we estimate additional deaths at 27,000. The results suggest an important role for UI during infectious stages of pandemics that should be considered for future policy design.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <hr style="height:3px;border-width:1;color:gray;background-color:gray"> <strong><font size="+2">Peer-Reviewed Publications</font></strong> <h2 class="bibliography">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div id="kimg2019project" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Design and Application of Korean Economic History Education Program Using Project-Based Learning</div> <div class="author"> Inae Kim, Sungbin Park, and Minsik Choi </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Korean Journal of Economic Education</em>, 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> (in Korean) </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://kiss.kstudy.com/Detail/Ar?key=3676788" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Education on modern Korean economic development history, which helps to learn various economic concepts empirically in historical context and foster decision-making skills, is not being taken actively in Korean secondary education. We developed three PBL programs, which consist of important events in the Korean contemporary economic development history, and carried out a pilot class. In addition, we also developed reading materials so that teachers and students could study advanced contents in depth. As a result of the pilot class carried out with students at the College of Education on Living History of Heavy and Chemical Industries, a high level of satisfaction was obtained regarding the adequacy, practicality, knowledge acquisition, interest, and intention to use the program. The satisfaction of students who plan to be teachers and those who do not plan to be teachers showed no statistical differences. This implies that the program is satisfactory not only for teachers but also for general audience. Our PBL programs for Korean economic history, which have not been existed, could be actively used in real classrooms.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2017</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div id="jeon2017time" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Time Preference and Economic Decision Making in Aging: Focusing on Implications for Economics Education</div> <div class="author"> Eunji Jeon, Sungbin Park, and Minsik Choi </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Research in Curriculum Instruction</em>, 2017 </div> <div class="periodical"> (in Korean) </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/articleDetail?nodeId=NODE09000771" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This study focuses on older adults who are over 60 years old and investigates the relationship between time preferences and some related variables to understand the characteristics of elderly people’s economic decision making. We investigate the time preferences of 73 elderly men and women living in Seoul by using the rate of time discount suggested by behavioral economics. The rate of time discounted is well known as an important explanatory variable that indicates an individual’s impulsiveness, self-control, and present orientation. We discovered that older adults’ average rate of time discount was lower than that of young adults, and this result was statistically significant. This result implies that aged people are less likely to be impulsive and more likely to show higher self-control. We also found that those who identify with the aged group and think that their remaining life is relatively shorter show higher rates of time discount than those who consider themselves still ‘not old enough’. In addition, older adults with disability also tended to show higher rates of time discount. This implies that lifelong economics education is needed to promote the ability of economic decision making with longer term perspective.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <hr style="height:3px;border-width:1;color:gray;background-color:gray"> <strong><font size="+2">Work-in-Progress</font></strong> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Sungbin Park.
